        <h2 style="text-align: center">Underlisten</h2>
        <p style="color: white"><em>Underlisten(UL)</em> is the first game of BLIZENDO, and it is popular for its special game system and fascinating plot. It is about a world which is full of crime. The Third World War broke out, people used nuclear weapons on a large scale, the earth became a wilderness, people established the World Government. And Underlisten is a organization that founded by the World Government for the peace of the world. However, it is said that the World Government is planning a terrible plot. So, what is the truth?</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">World of Peaceskill</h2>
        <p style="color: white">In 2005, BLIZENDO made <em>World of Peaceskill</em>, one of the best-selling games in the world. It was the <em><strong>FIRST</strong></em> game that combine MMORPG with MOBA and TPS. The plot of the <em>World of Peaceskill(WOP)</em> is so interesting that it still has about 5,000,000 active players now. In the story of WOP, there is a land called Peaceland, and there are two camps which are Alliance and Horde. The humans lead the Alliance, while the orcs lead the Horde. There is no war between the people here, only peace and love.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">Legend of Panda</h2>
        <p style="color: white">In 2010, the BLIZENDO create their own game player, <em>BLIZENDO PLUG(BP)</em>, which means a new era. And <em>The Legend of Panda(TLP)</em> was the first game on the BP, so it is an epoch-making game. The TLP is about a story of the pandas, there are many pandas in a land called <em>Pandaland</em>, which is a peaceful land. However, an evil man came to the Pandaland and kidnap the princess of the pandas. A warrior named Quit set out to save the princess.</p>

         <h2 style="text-align: center">Real World</h2>
        <p style="color: white"><em>Real World(RW)</em> is a milestone in the history of games, for which it looks just like the real world(here is a screenshot of the RW). Besides this, <em>Complete Immersion Experience(CIE)</em>, which means you can enter the game completely by wearing electrodes on your head, is also one of the features of the game. RW has successfully set off a wave of CIE games, I believe that in the near future there will be more and more CIEs on the market.</p>
